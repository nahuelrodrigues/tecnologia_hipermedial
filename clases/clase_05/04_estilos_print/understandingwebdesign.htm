      <p>We get better design when we understand our medium. Yet
        even at this late cultural hour, many people don’t understand web
        design. Among them can be found some of our most distinguished business
        and cultural leaders, including a few who possess a profound grasp of
        design—except as it relates to the web.</p>
      <p>Some who don’t
        understand web design nevertheless have the job of creating websites or
        supervising web designers and developers. Others who don’t understand
        web design are nevertheless professionally charged with evaluating it
        on behalf of the rest of us. Those who understand the least make the
        most noise. They are the ones leading charges, slamming doors, and
        throwing money—at all the wrong people and things.</p>
      <p>If we want better sites, better work, and better-informed clients, the need to educate begins with us.</p>
      <h2>Preferring real estate to architecture</h2>
      <p>It’s hard to
        understand web design when you don’t understand the web. And it’s hard
        to understand the web when those who are paid to explain it either
        don’t get it themselves, or are obliged for commercial reasons to
        suppress some of what they know, emphasizing the Barnumesque over the
        brilliant.</p>
      <p>The news media too often gets it wrong. Too
        much internet journalism follows the money; too little covers art and
        ideas. Driven by editors pressured by publishers worried about
        vanishing advertisers, even journalists who understand the web spend
        most of their time writing about deals and quoting dealmakers. Many do
        this even when the statement they’re quoting is patently self-serving
        and ludicrous—like <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/valleyspeak/zuckerbergs-law-once-every-hundred-years-media-changes-320289.php">Zuckerberg’s Law</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s
        not that Zuckerberg’s not news; and it’s not that business isn’t some
        journalists’ beat. But focusing on business to the exclusion of all
        else is like reporting on real estate deals while ignoring architecture.</p>
      <p>And
        one tires of the news narrative’s one-dimensionalism. In 1994, the web
        was weird and wild, they told us. In ‘99 it was a kingmaker; in ‘01, a
        bust. In ‘02, news folk discovered blogs; in ‘04, perspiring guest
        bloggers on <span class="caps">CNN</span> explained how citizen
        journalists were reinventing news and democracy and would determine who
        won that year’s presidential election. I forget how that one turned out.</p>
      <p>When
        absurd predictions die ridiculous deaths, nobody resigns from the
        newsroom, they just throw a new line into the water—like marketers
        replacing a slogan that tanked. After decades of news commoditization,
        what’s amazing is how many good reporters there still are, and how hard
        many try to lay accurate information before the public. Sometimes you
        can almost hear it beneath the roar of the grotesque and the
        exceptional.</p>
      <h3>The sustainable circle of self-regard</h3>
      <p>News media are
        not the only ones getting it wrong. Professional associations get it
        wrong every day, and commemorate their wrongness with an annual
        festival. Each year, advertising and design magazines and professional
        organizations hold contests for “new media design” judged by the
        winners of last year’s competitions. That they call it “new media
        design” tells them nothing and you and me everything.</p>
      <p>Although
        there are exceptions, for the most part the creators of winning entries
        see the web as a vehicle for advertising and marketing campaigns in
        which the user passively experiences Flash and video content. For the
        active user, there is gaming—but what you and I think of as active web
        use is limited to clicking a “Digg this page” button.</p>
      <p>The
        winning sites look fabulous as screen shots in glossy design annuals.
        When the winners become judges, they reward work like their own. Thus
        sites that behave like TV and look good between covers continue to be
        created, and a generation of clients and art directors thinks that
        stuff is the cream of web design.</p>
      <h3>Design critics get it wrong, too</h3>
      <p>People who are smart
        about print can be less bright about the web. Their critical faculties,
        honed to perfection during the Kerning Wars, smash to bits against the
        barricades of our profession.</p>
      <p>The less sophisticated
        lament on our behalf that we are stuck with ugly fonts. They wonder
        aloud how we can enjoy working in a medium that offers us less than
        absolute control over every atom of the visual experience. What they
        are secretly asking is whether or not we are real designers. (They
        suspect that we are not.) But these are the juniors, the design
        students and future critics. Their opinions are chiefly of interest to
        their professors, and one prays they have good ones.</p>
      <p>More
        sophisticated critics understand that the web is not print and that
        limitations are part of every design discipline. Yet even these
        eggheads will sometimes succumb to fallacious comparatives. (I’ve <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/old/orson.html">done it myself</a>,
        although long ago and strictly for giggles.) Where are the masterpieces
        of web design, these critics cry. That Google Maps might be as
        representative of our age as the Mona Lisa was of Leonardo’s—and as
        brilliant, in its way—satisfies many of us as an answer, but might not
        satisfy the design critic in search of a direct parallel to, oh, I
        don’t know, let’s say Milton Glaser’s iconic Bob Dylan poster.</p>
      <h2>Typography, architecture, and web design</h2>
      <p>The trouble
        is, web design, although it employs elements of graphic design and
        illustration, does not map to them. If one must compare the web to
        other media, typography would be a better choice. For a web design,
        like a typeface, is an environment for someone else’s expression. Stick
        around and I’ll tell you which site design is like Helvetica.</p>
      <p>Architecture
        (the kind that uses steel and glass and stone) is also an apt
        comparison—or at least, more apt than poster design. The architect
        creates planes and grids that facilitate the dynamic behavior of
        people. Having designed, the architect relinquishes control. Over time,
        the people who use the building bring out and add to the meaning of the
        architect’s design.</p>
      <p>Of course, all comparisons are gnarly
        by nature. What is the “London Calling” of television? Who is the Jane
        Austen of automotive design? Madame Butterfly is not less beautiful for
        having no car chase sequence, peanut butter no less tasty because it
        cannot dance.</p>
      <h3>So what is web design?</h3>
      <p>Web design is not book design,
        it is not poster design, it is not illustration, and the highest
        achievements of those disciplines are not what web design aims for.
        Although websites can be delivery systems for games and videos, and
        although those delivery systems can be lovely to look at, such sites
        are exemplars of game design and video storytelling, not of web design.
        So what is web design?</p>
      <p>Web design is the creation of
        digital environments that facilitate and encourage human activity;
        reflect or adapt to individual voices and content; and change
        gracefully over time while always retaining their identity.</p>
      <p>Let’s repeat that, with emphasis:</p>
      <p><em>Web
        design is the creation of digital environments that facilitate and
        encourage human activity; reflect or adapt to individual voices and
        content; and change gracefully over time while always retaining their
        identity.</em></p>
      <h3>She walks in beauty</h3>
      <p>Great web designs are like great typefaces: some, like <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0003158">Rosewood</a>, impose a personality on whatever content is applied to them. Others, like <a href="http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=helvetica&amp;producttype=TYP&amp;pricemodel=RM%2CRF">Helvetica</a>,
        fade into the background (or try to), magically supporting whatever
        tone the content provides. (We can argue tomorrow whether Helvetica is
        really as neutral as water.)</p>
      <p>Which web design is like that? For one, Douglas Bowman’s white “<a href="http://ekspeditsionist.blogspot.com/">Minima</a>” layout for Blogger, used by literally <a href="http://minimatesttest.blogspot.com/">millions</a> of <a href="http://leukemialetters.blogspot.com/">writers</a>—and it feels like it was designed for <a href="http://apartness.blogspot.com/2005/04/elephants-on-34th-street-nyc.html">each</a> of them <a href="http://weddingdecorator.blogspot.com/2007/09/new-permanent-layout.html">individually</a>. That is great design.</p>
      <p>Great
        web designs are like great buildings. All office buildings, however
        distinctive, have lobbies and bathrooms and staircases. Websites, too,
        share commonalities.</p>
      <p>Although a great site design is
        completely individual, it is also a great deal like other site designs
        that perform similar functions. The same is true of great magazine and
        newspaper layouts, which differ from banal magazine and newspaper
        layouts in a hundred subtle details. Few celebrate great magazine
        layouts, yet millions consciously or unconsciously appreciate them, and
        nobody laments that they are not posters.</p>
      <p>The
        inexperienced or insufficiently thoughtful designer complains that too
        many websites use grids, too many sites use columns, too many sites are
        “boxy.” Efforts to avoid boxiness have been around since 1995; while
        occasionally successful, they have most often produced aesthetically
        wretched and needlessly unusable designs.</p>
      <p>The experienced
        web designer, like the talented newspaper art director, accepts that
        many projects she works on will have headers and columns and footers.
        Her job is not to whine about emerging commonalities but to use them to
        create pages that are distinctive, natural, brand-appropriate, subtly
        memorable, and quietly but unmistakably engaging.</p>
      <p>If she
        achieves all that and sweats the details, her work will be beautiful.
        If not everyone appreciates this beauty—if not everyone understands web
        design—then let us not cry for web design, but for those who cannot
        see. <img src="img/eoai.gif" alt="" id="eoai" /></p>
